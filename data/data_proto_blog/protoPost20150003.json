Winter break is finally over and we, the Prototypes, have hit the ground running.   We started off today’s meeting by providing a presentation about Recycle Rush, which is the 2015 FRC game. Robotics officers spent time explaining the game to the members and went over the game animation.  After the presentation, the Prototypes split into the mechanical department and the programming and electrical department.  We continued to brainstorm ideas for strategies and pick up designs and spent time working on our electrical board.  Also, we began sketching out potential gripping systems and assembled gear boxes that are going to be implemented into our chassis.  Overall, we had a successful and productive meeting.  We can’t wait to see you guys tomorrow!","$$hashKey":"object:42"}]}
