We, the Prototypes, decided to work downstairs in the spare room since it was more convenient for retrieving tools. Code was revisited, tough boxes were fixed, and electrical parts were organized. Although several members worked on prototyping, we were stopped by our mentor since he did not agree with our designs. He did not provide us with concrete ideas that he wanted to implement in our design, so when the meeting was adjourned, we decided that it was in the team’s best interest to communicate with our mentor and ask him to provide us with exactly what he wants done and the reasoning behind it so that we can understand our faults without reducing our efficiently or falling behind schedule.","$$hashKey":"object:165"},{"type":"text","content":"It was a valuable lesson for us all since we were able to exercise our communication skills in order to create a positive working environment. Unfortunately, there is only one image from today’s meeting since the photographer was preoccupied with tough boxes. (Rest assured that there will be a plethora of photographs coming your way tomorrow). Until then, we hope you have a pleasant evening!","$$hashKey":"object:168"}]}
